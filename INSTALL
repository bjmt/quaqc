System requirements
===================

GNU Make and a C compiler (gcc/clang) are required to compile quaqc.

quaqc depends on the following external libraries:

    Zlib    <http://zlib.net>
    HTSlib  <http://www.htslib.org>

Configuring external libraries
==============================

These dependencies come prepackaged with quaqc, within the ./libs directory.
To compile these as static libraries, run the following:

    make libz
    make libhts

The provided Zlib is the optimized Cloudfare fork. The provided HTSlib is
version 1.17 of the library, with the compiler optimization flag set to -O3.
Additionally, this copy of HTSlib does not link to the libbz2 and liblzma
libraries, which are needed for full CRAM file format support. If system-wide
shared libraries are available, they can be linked during compilation of
HTSlib using with_lzma=1 and with_bz2=1 as follows:

    make with_lzma=1 with_bz2=1 libhts

HTSlib also tries to link to LIBDEFLATE by default if present, though this
has been disabled for the prepackaged HTSlib. To re-enable it:

    make with_deflate=1 libhts

Finally, curl support is disabled by default. To enable it, use with_curl=1
if a system-wide shared library is available:

    make with_curl=1 libhts

This allows quaqc to work with CRAM files which require a remote connection.
In all cases, make sure to again provide these options when compiling quaqc
itself, for example:

    make with_lzma=1 with_bz2=1 with_deflate=1 with_curl=1 release

If shared libraries are not available system-wide, they can be used by
specifying the LDLIBS environment variable.

To instead use different static library installations, set the ZDIR and
HTSDIR environment variables when compiling quaqc. For example:

    make ZDIR=<DIR> HTSDIR=<DIR> release

To instead use system-wide shared libraries, set z_dyn=1 and hts_dyn=1 when
compiling quaqc as follows:

    make z_dyn=1 hts_dyn=1 release

Basic installation
==================

Run the following commands from within the project folder:

    make release-full
    make install
    make clean

The first command will compile the prepackaged external libraries as static
libraries, then compile quaqc itself. The second command will move the quaqc
binary to /usr/local/bin (configurable by setting the PREFIX and BINDIR
environment variables), though this step is optional. This also moves the
manual page to /usr/local/share/man/man1. (configurable by setting the PREFIX and
MANDIR environment variables). The final command will clean up intermediate
files from the compilation process.

Custom installation
===================

When adjusting the compilation process of prepackaged libraries, or using
different library installations altogether (see "Configuring external
libraries"), ensure that quaqc is compiled standalone as follows:

    make release

This skips the compilation of the prepackaged libraries.

By default quaqc is compiled without CPU-specific optimizations. To enable
these, set native=1:

    make native=1 release

Beware that this option is not available on all systems.

See the Makefile for additional environmental variables which be set to adjust
the compilation process of quaqc.
