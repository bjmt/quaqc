CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1 (2024-06-13)
-----------------------------------

* Added --strict flag: Use strict filtering parameters from manuscript

* Overlapping ranges provided to --tss are now removed to prevent imbalanced
  pileups due to reads only being counted for the first overlapping range
  even if multiple overlapping ranges exist

* Fixed a bug with read overlap detection for --tss option
