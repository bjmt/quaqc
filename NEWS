CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3 (2025-05-04)
-----------------------------------

* Added the ability to filter reads using alternate SAM tags instead of
  read groups (RG) via --rg-tag. 

* Fixed some bugs in the --bedGraph implementation.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2 (2025-05-03)
-----------------------------------

* Added bedGraph output (--bedGraph). The behaviour of the output pileup
  is similar to the pileup created by the --tss option, with the ability
  to either make a pileup from the exact read coordinates or centered
  around resized 5-prime coordinates.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1 (2024-06-13)
-----------------------------------

* Added --strict flag: Use strict filtering parameters from manuscript

* Overlapping ranges provided to --tss are now removed to prevent imbalanced
  pileups due to reads only being counted for the first overlapping range
  even if multiple overlapping ranges exist

* Fixed a bug with read overlap detection for --tss option
